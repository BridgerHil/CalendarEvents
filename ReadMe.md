### Use Guide

Place the 'getCalEvents.py' into unzipped GroupMe export folder, which contains folders containing several json files. In a terminal window and having python installed, navigate to the GroupMe export folder, enter:

```cmd

    python getCalEvents.py

```

In the terminal all events and information will be rendered.

### Future Use

The printing will be optional, and the events will be inputted to a calendar API to be saved on the host's calendar.
